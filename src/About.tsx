                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I started exploring tech at 11 with Arduino projects. By 15, I was building tools in <span className="python">Python</span>, and today, I’m an undergraduate focused on <span className="highlight">backend development, cybersecurity, and ethical hacking.</span>

                    I love building secure systems and clean APIs with <span className="django">Django</span> and <span className="react">React.</span> Whether it’s crafting a solid backend or experimenting with UI, I’m always <span className="highlight2">building, learning, and leveling up.</span>

                </p>
